# ADS-503 Final Team Project: Parkinson's Telemonitoring

This project explores the potential of vocal biomarkers to predict early signs of motor symptom changes in Parkinson’s Disease patients. The goal is to use predictive modeling to assist in early clinical intervention.

## Project Contents

- `parkinsons_telemonitoring.csv/` — Contains the `parkinsons_updrs.data` and `.names` files from the UCI dataset.
- `Final_Project_Report-Team4.Rmd` — The main Quarto/R Markdown report.
- `README.md` — Project description and guidance.

## Problem Statement

Can subtle fluctuations in vocal biomarkers be used to predict early signs of motor symptom changes in Parkinson’s Disease patients, enabling timely clinical interventions?

## Methods & Tools Used

- Data Exploration (EDA)
- Feature Engineering (voice-based variables)
- Predictive Modeling:
  - Random Forest
  - LASSO Regression
- **Interactive Dashboard**:
  - Built using **R Shiny** to visualize patterns and predictions

## Tools & Libraries

- R (tidyverse, caret, randomForest, glmnet, shiny)
- Quarto / R Markdown
- Git / GitHub

## Team Members

- Vinh Dao
- Arjun Venkatesh
- Anahit Shekikyan

## Notes

- This project is part of the **ADS-503** course at the **University of San Diego**.
- Data sourced from the [UCI Parkinson’s Telemonitoring Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Parkinsons+Telemonitoring).
